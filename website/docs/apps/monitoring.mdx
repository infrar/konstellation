Observability is a critical piece of any production infrastructure. Konstellation comes configured with Kube dashboard, Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager, as well as pre-configured dashboards for the apps that you deploy.

## Monitoring with grafana

`kon launch grafana` will launch a browser to the Grafana instance through a proxy to your cluster. You'll find a series of dashboard pre-configured for your cluster.
