title: Monitoring & Alerting
---

Observability is a critical piece of any production infrastructure. Konstellation comes configured with Kube dashboard, Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager, as well as a set of dashboards for the apps that you deploy.

You can also use the same Prometheus instance to collect additional metrics about your apps.

## Launching tools

Monitoring and observability tools run within your cluster, and are inaccessible to the internet. Konstellation makes it easy to get to these tools with the `launch` command. It opens up a [secure proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/proxies/#proxies) to services within the cluster.

## Kubernetes dashboard

`kon launch kubedash` starts the Kubernetes Dashboard. Because the dashboard gives you full control over the cluster, authentication is required. Konstellation generates a secret token for each cluster, and the launch command displays prints it out so you can copy and paste to authenticate.

## Monitoring with Grafana

`kon launch grafana` will launch a browser to the Grafana instance. You'll find a series of dashboard pre-configured for your cluster. We'll highlight a couple of them that you should check out.

### App overview

This dashboard is a quick way of getting the key metrics about your app, including releases and pods, throughput and success rate, as well as CPU and memory utilization.

### Istio mesh
