title: Monitoring
---

Observability is a critical piece of any production infrastructure. Konstellation comes configured with Kube dashboard, Prometheus ([prometheus-operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator)), Grafana, AlertManager, as well as a set of dashboards for the apps that are deploy.

You can also use the same Prometheus instance to collect additional metrics about your apps.

## Launching tools

Monitoring and observability tools run within your cluster, and are inaccessible to the internet. Konstellation makes it easy to get to these tools with the `launch` command. It opens up a [secure proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/proxies/#proxies) to services within the cluster.

## Kubernetes dashboard

`kon launch kubedash` starts the Kubernetes Dashboard. Because the dashboard gives you full control over the cluster, authentication is required. Konstellation generates a secret token for each cluster, and the launch command displays prints it out so you can copy and paste to authenticate.

## Monitoring with Grafana

`kon launch grafana` will launch a browser to the Grafana instance. You'll find a series of dashboard pre-configured for your cluster. We'll highlight a couple of them that you should check out.

### App overview

This dashboard is a quick way of getting the key metrics about apps, including releases and pods, throughput and success rate, as well as CPU and memory utilization.

### Istio mesh

An overview of the health of the service mesh. It's useful when it comes to diagnosing the current flow of traffic.

### Adding new dashboards

Konstellation uses [Grafana Operator](https://github.com/integr8ly/grafana-operator), and you can define additional dashboards via the CRD [GrafanaDashboard](https://github.com/integr8ly/grafana-operator/blob/master/documentation/dashboards.md). Once created, it'll be applied to Grafana automatically.

## Prometheus

The pre-configured Prometheus install runs redundant with two instances. Metric data is stored on an EBS volume attached to each instance (set up as a persistent volume). Launch Prometheus web UI with `kon launch prometheus`.

This Prometheus install is configured to collect metrics for the cluster and Istio mesh, including data that it could observe about apps.

### Collecting app metrics

The default setup could provide basic metrics observable from outside of apps, but to measure app-specific metrics, you need to integrate one of the Prometheus [client libraries](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/) and expose a metric endpoint on one of the ports. You can enable Prometheus scraping by setting the [prometheus](../reference/manifest#prometheusspec) field in the manifest.

```yaml title="App.yaml"
apiVersion: k11n.dev/v1alpha1
kind: App
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
...
  prometheus:
    endpoints:
    - port: http
      interval: 15s  # s, m suffixes
      # override path if you aren't able to surface metrics on the default /metrics path
      # path: /metrics
```

Konstellation uses [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator) and will set up a ServiceMonitor for the app. The above setup will instruct Prometheus to scrape the `http` port every 10 seconds.
