Konstellation is a new project and we'll be glad to help you get started.

## Slack

We have a Slack set up for users of Konstellation. Let us know with your questions and feedback.

## Support Service

If you are looking for something more than the public support channel, or need hands-on help, we can point you to the right direction. Shoot me a note: dz at konstellation.dev
